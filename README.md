# AStarTraversal
The AStarTraversal application is a web application which implements the AStar Search Algorithm which is used to efficiently plot traversable path between multiple points which are called as nodes. 

Note:  My best working codes were in my work experience when I worked for Cognizant Technology solutions where I was a part of the development team which developed the Forex Application for American Express using WPF(XAML), WCF, C#, SQL Server, SSRS and in University of Illinois at Chicago where I worked as a Web Developer Graduate Assistant developing Faculty and Student Management Application using ASP.Net, SQL Server. Since I cannot share these code samples I gave the code for the project which I did as a part of my academic course.
